# My closed source profile

I got interested in development in the 00s when I starting scripting NPCs for text-based games, and then started building web games, and now I have been architecting full web applications full time for the last decade+ (not just front-end, but AWS serverless infrastructure, and architectural design).

- 👋 Hi, I’m @rrsai for closed source and [@tchalvak for open source](https://github.com/tchalvak).
- 👀 I’m interested in Serverless AWS, React, AWS Amplify, and NLP.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Astro.js for static site generation _with full components_
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full serverless apps.
- 📫 How to reach me: Just @roy me on slack.
